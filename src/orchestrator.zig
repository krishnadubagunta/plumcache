//! This module defines the Orchestrator, a central component in PlumCache
//! responsible for managing the entire lifecycle of plugins.
//!
//! The Orchestrator acts as an extensibility manager, enabling dynamic discovery,
//! loading, initialization, and coordination of various plugins. It serves
//! as the bridge between the core database functionality and external
//! extensions, allowing PlumCache to be customized and expanded without
//! altering its core codebase.
//!
//! Key responsibilities include:
//! - **Plugin Discovery**: Identifying available plugins based on configuration.
//! - **Plugin Loading**: Loading plugin binaries or modules into memory.
//! - **Plugin Initialization**: Setting up plugins and preparing them for execution.
//! - **Hook Management**: Registering plugin functions to specific hooks within
//!   the PlumCache operation lifecycle (e.g., `BeforeSave`, `AfterGet`).
//! - **Dependency Resolution**: (Future) Managing inter-plugin dependencies.
//! - **Execution Order**: (Future) Ensuring plugins run in a defined order.
//!
//! By centralizing plugin management, the Orchestrator ensures a robust and
//! flexible architecture for extending PlumCache's capabilities.
